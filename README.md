Hello

My name is Jeremy. I'm 28 years old. I've been programming as a hobby for a few years now. I initially started in high school working with modeling and animation in a program called Lightwave. I made a few characters and simple animations (like walk/run animations, pictures of the characters.. basics). Then I was introduced into programming while I was in community college which peaked my interest so I started doing that here and there with no real goal. Just fun stuff. Fast forward to now, I love programming and have taught myself for the most part. I enrolled with Southern New Hampshire University in there Game Programming and Development BS program at the start of 2018 (with a goal of finishing in early 2020). I've learned a lot and am now actively searching for a software engineer job where I can expand my programming skills and get hands on experience working with others as enthusiastic about the craft as I am.
